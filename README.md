# PHSX815_Week6

PHSX815_HW7.py: This script approximates the integral of the function f(x) over the user provided integration bounds [a, b] using the Monte Carlo method with N sample points. The user can hard code a different function in line 47, and the script will output a plot of Integral Value vs. Number of sample points to test the Monte Carlo method's accuracy. NOTE: The function f(x) must be positive for the given bounds. I haven't quite figured out how to implement the method over integration bounds where f(x) is both positive and negative.
